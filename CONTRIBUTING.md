# Uxn Suite Documentation Contribution Guide

Welcome to the Uxn Suite Documentation Contribution Guide! We're thrilled you're interested in contributing to our documentation. This guide is intended to help you understand our standards and practices to ensure consistency and quality in our documentation.

## Writing Style

1. **Clarity and Conciseness**: Write in a clear, concise manner. Avoid jargon and complex terminology. Where technical terms are necessary, provide simple explanations.

2. **Active Voice**: Use active voice. For example, "You can create a file using..." instead of "A file can be created using...".

3. **Second Person**: Address the reader directly using the second person ("you") where appropriate.

4. **Consistency**: Follow the established tone and style of the existing documentation.

## Formatting

1. **Markdown**: All documentation should be written in Markdown. Familiarize yourself with basic Markdown syntax.

2. **Headers**: Use headers to structure your document logically. Start with `#` for main titles, `##` for secondary titles, and so on.

3. **Lists**: Use bulleted lists for unordered items and numbered lists for sequential steps or instructions.

4. **Code Blocks**: When including code, use code blocks. Specify the language for syntax highlighting where applicable.

5. **Links**: Use relative links for internal references and descriptive link texts.

## Structure

1. **Document Titles**: The title of the document should match the corresponding section in the Table of Contents.

2. **Introduction**: Start with an introduction that outlines the purpose and scope of the document.

3. **Body**: Organize the main content logically, using headers to separate major sections.

4. **Conclusion**: End with a summary or conclusion, if appropriate.

2. **Examples**: Where possible, include examples to illustrate concepts.

3. **Accessibility**: Write in a way that is accessible to as wide an audience as possible.

## File and Directory Naming

1. **Hyphens for Spaces**: Use hyphens (`-`) instead of spaces in file and directory names.

2. **Lowercase**: Use lowercase for all file and directory names.

3. **Descriptive Names**: Names should be descriptive and reflect the content of the file or directory.

## Review Process

1. **Pull Requests**: Contributions should be submitted via pull requests.

2. **Peer Review**: Expect your submissions to undergo a peer review process for feedback and suggestions.

3. **Revision**: Be open to revising your contribution based on feedback received.
